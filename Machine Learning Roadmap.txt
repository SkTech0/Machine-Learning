Machine Learning Roadmap


Data Manipulation:

Write code to load a dataset (e.g., CSV, JSON) into a Pandas DataFrame.
Perform basic data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Data Visualization:

Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms) of the dataset to explore its characteristics and relationships between variables.

Model Training:

Implement code to train machine learning models using popular libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
Train a classifier (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, neural network) on a given dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Write code to perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameters for a machine learning model.

Cross-Validation:

Implement cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to assess the performance of a model and avoid overfitting.

Feature Engineering:

Create new features or transform existing features in a dataset to improve the performance of a machine learning model.
Use techniques such as polynomial features, feature scaling, or feature selection to preprocess the data.

Model Evaluation:

Write code to compute evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC score, and confusion matrix for a classification problem.
Use techniques like learning curves or validation curves to analyze the performance of a model and identify potential issues (e.g., overfitting, underfitting).

Deployment:

Implement code to deploy a trained machine learning model as a RESTful API using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.
Write code to make predictions using the deployed model and handle incoming requests from clients.

Handling Imbalanced Data:

Write code to handle imbalanced datasets using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights in the model training process.

Model Interpretability:

Use libraries like SHAP or LIME to explain the predictions of a machine learning model and interpret its behavior.
